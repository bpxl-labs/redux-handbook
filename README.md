# [Black Pixel Redux Handbook](http://bpxl-labs.github.io/redux-handbook/)

[Black Pixel](https://blackpixel.com/) has been using Redux in production for quite a while now. It has served us incredibly well and over time we have developed a few best practices. This book serves as a guideline for scaling Redux applications effectively. It is also an invaluable resource to get your team all following the same conventions and patterns. This book assumes some light Redux knowledge but we offer plenty of resource links for beginners just in case.

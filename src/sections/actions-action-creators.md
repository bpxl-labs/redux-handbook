# Actions & Action Creators

## Actions

All actions should follow the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) structure. In short:

> An action **MUST**

> - be a plain JavaScript object.
> - have a `type` property.

> An action **MAY**

> - have a `error` property.
> - have a `payload` property.
> - have a `meta` property.

> An action **MUST NOT** include properties other than `type`, `payload`, and `error`, and `meta`.

This makes it incredibly easy for a developer to know the exact structure of an incoming action when working inside a reducer. It also allows you to utilize destructuring inside your reducers for more terse code:

```javascript
export function todos(state = [], { type, payload }) {
  switch (type) {
    case TODO_ADD:
      return todos.push(payload);

    default: return state;
  }
}
```

## Action Creators

Action creators at their basic form are just functions that return an object. Given this flexibility you are able to create them in a number of different ways. We recommend that you keep them small and focused and inlined with the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) structure.

Be careful when adding in middleware libraries as they each add a layer of complexity and abstraction to your code. Action creators should always be small and explicit, so they are predictable and easily testable.

#### Asynchronous Actions

At Black Pixel, we keep things extremely simple by using [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for our asynchronous actions. `Redux-thunk` simply returns a function instead of an object inside of your action creators. With `redux-thunk` you can control when an action is dispatched based on certain criteria (since weâ€™re just calling an inner function) and it does not require ramp up time for new developers. If your action requires an HTTP request, use [redux-requests](https://github.com/idolize/redux-requests) or similar. This ensures you are not dispatching multiple HTTP calls and state updates when calling action creators.

#### Dispatching Multiple Actions

If you need to dispatch multiple actions at once, use [redux-batched-actions](https://github.com/tshelburne/redux-batched-actions).

## Action Type Naming Convention

Since naming things is one of the harder areas in programming, here is a set of guidelines to help you name your action types:

1. Action types **must** have a namespace. E.g., `TODO_ADD` (`TODO` being the namespace and `ADD` being the type).
2. Action namespace **must** come before action type.
3. Asynchronous action types **must** use a present tense and past tense to determine HTTP state. E.g., `TODO:ADDING` and `TODO:ADDED`.
4. Error actions **must** append `ERROR` to the action type. E.g., `TODO:ADD_ERROR`.

Use your best judgement when naming an action, so they are short and descriptive.

## Reducing Boilerplate

A standard way of creating an action is like so:

```javascript
export function someAction() {
  return {
    type: SOME_ACTION,
    payload: {
      foo: 'bar'
    },
  };
}
```

With libraries, such as [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions), this can be shortened to:

```javascript
export const someAction = createAction(SOME_ACTION, () => ({ foo: 'bar' }));
// or
export const someAction = createAction(SOME_ACTION)({ foo: 'bar' });
```
